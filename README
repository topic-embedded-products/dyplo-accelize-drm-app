First build the DRM library as described:

sudo apt install -y git make g++ libcurl4-openssl-dev libjsoncpp-dev cmake
git clone https://github.com/Accelize/drm.git --recursive --depth 1
cd drm
mkdir build
cd build
# jsoncpp doesn't have a pkg-config file so you need to provide
# the include dir setting by hand
cmake .. -DJSONCPP_INCLUDEDIR=/usr/include/jsoncpp
make -j 8
sudo make install


Build the application by running "make".

Note: The current Makefile will not work when cross-compiled because of the 'hard' CXXFLAGS needed for the JSON library.

If you installed the accelize_drm library in its default location
(/usr/local/lib) you'll need to run the application like this:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./dyplo-accelize-drm-app

If you get "Failed to mmap /dev/dyplo-drm", its probably about file permissions, give users access using:
  sudo chmod a+rw /dev/dyplo-drm
