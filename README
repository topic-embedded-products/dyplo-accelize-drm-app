First build the DRM library as described:

sudo apt install -y git make g++ libcurl4-openssl-dev libjsoncpp-dev cmake
git clone https://github.com/Accelize/drm.git --recursive --depth 1
cd drm
mkdir build
cd build
# To make this work, I had to "steal" a cmake from openembedded because the
# default one in my ubunut 18 was too old.
# Also jsoncpp doesn't appear to have a pkg-config file so I had to provide
# the include dir setting by hand
cmake .. -DJSONCPP_INCLUDEDIR=/usr/include/jsoncpp
make -j 8
sudo make install
